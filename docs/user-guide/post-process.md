# Post-Process (Global PTQ / Block-wise PTQ / Router Fine-Tuning / LoRA SFT)

OneComp supports **post-quantization processing** — additional steps applied to a quantized model to improve accuracy or inject domain-specific knowledge. Four implementations are available:

- **Global PTQ** — Globally optimises quantization parameters (scales, zeros, scaling factors) via KL distillation from a full-precision teacher model
- **Block-wise PTQ** — Minimises intermediate-representation MSE against an FP16 teacher model at Transformer-block granularity. No training data labelling required.
- **Router Fine-Tuning** — Recovers quantized MoE quality by training only router parameters with next-token prediction loss while experts and all other weights remain frozen.
- **LoRA SFT** — Fine-tunes quantized models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters with SFT loss, optional teacher distillation, and intermediate block alignment.

## Overview

The post-process framework integrates into the `Runner` pipeline via the `post_processes` parameter. After quantization completes, `Runner` builds a quantized model on CPU and executes each process in order. The processed model is stored as `runner.quantized_model` and is automatically used by subsequent evaluation and save operations.

```
Quantize ──► Build Model ──► Post-Process 1 ──► Post-Process 2 ──► Evaluate / Save
                              (e.g. GlobalPTQ)   (e.g. LoRA SFT)
```

## Load -> Post-process -> Re-save

Saved quantized checkpoints can be loaded, refined with additional
structure-preserving post-processes, and saved again. Load with
`device_map=None` to keep the model on CPU before `run_post_processes()`:

```python
from onecomp import BlockWisePTQ, CalibrationConfig, ModelConfig, Runner, load_quantized_model

model_config = ModelConfig(
    model_id="TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T",
    device="cuda:0",
)

model, _ = load_quantized_model(
    "./tinyllama-gptq4-initial",
    device_map=None,
)

runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=None,
    post_processes=[
        BlockWisePTQ(
            lr=1e-4,
            epochs=10,
            cbq_enable=True,
            calibration_config=CalibrationConfig(num_calibration_samples=128),
        )
    ],
)
runner.quantized_model = model
runner.run_post_processes()
runner.save_quantized_model("./tinyllama-gptq4-blockwise-resaved")
```

`quantizer=None` is valid for this flow because `runner.quantized_model` is
assigned before calling `run_post_processes()`. Each post-process run that
completes without raising appends an entry to
`quantization_config["onecomp_post_processes"]`, so the audit metadata
accumulates across repeated load -> post-process -> re-save cycles. Every
entry records an `executed` flag; when a post-process skips its work (for
example `GlobalPTQ` on a model with no quantized layers) the entry records
`executed: false` together with a `reason` such as `not_quantized`.

!!! tip
    A complete working example is available at
    [`example/post_process/example_reload_post_process_resave.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_reload_post_process_resave.py).

## Global PTQ: Parameter Optimisation

Global PTQ improves quantized model accuracy by globally optimising continuous quantization parameters (scales and zeros for GPTQLinear-backed quantizers such as GPTQ, RTN, and JointQ; scaling factors for DBF) using KL-divergence distillation from a full-precision teacher model.

### Single-GPU (GlobalPTQ)

```python
from onecomp import CalibrationConfig, DBF, GPTQ, JointQ, RTN, ModelConfig, Runner, GlobalPTQ, setup_logger

setup_logger()

model_config = ModelConfig(
    model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
    device="cuda:0",
)
quantizer = GPTQ(wbits=4, groupsize=128)
# quantizer = RTN(wbits=4, groupsize=128)
# quantizer = JointQ(bits=4, group_size=128)
# quantizer = DBF(target_bits=1.5)

global_ptq = GlobalPTQ(
    epochs=5,
    gptq_lr=1e-5,
    calibration_config=CalibrationConfig(
        num_calibration_samples=128,
        max_length=2048,
    ),
)

runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=quantizer,
    post_processes=[global_ptq],
)
runner.run()
```

To invoke GlobalPTQ directly on a model instance, use the following pattern
instead of passing it through `post_processes`:

```python
runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=quantizer,
)
runner.run()

model, _ = runner.create_quantized_model(use_gemlite=False)
post_process = global_ptq
post_process.run(model, model_config)
runner.quantized_model = model
```

The direct path uses the same post-process metadata recording as
`run_post_processes()`. For explicit unpacked buffers, use
`runner.create_quantized_model(pack_weights=False, use_gemlite=False)`; this is
only needed when GPTQLinear bit packing cannot represent the quantizer output
(e.g. 1-bit JointQ, or GPTQ/RTN bit widths outside `{2, 3, 4, 8}`), and is
documented in the `GlobalPTQ` API reference.

!!! tip
    A complete working example of the Runner-managed packed/default path (GPTQ
    by default; uncomment `DBF(target_bits=1.5)` in the script to run DBF) is
    available at
    [`example/post_process/example_global_ptq.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_global_ptq.py).

### Multi-GPU with DeepSpeed (GlobalPTQDistributed)

For large models that do not fit on a single GPU, use `GlobalPTQDistributed` with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2.

!!! note "Installation"
    Multi-GPU training requires DeepSpeed. Install it via the `distributed` extra:
    
    - **uv**: `uv sync --extra <cuda-extra> --extra distributed`
    - **pip**: `pip install "onecomp[distributed]"`

```python
from onecomp import CalibrationConfig, GPTQ, ModelConfig, Runner, GlobalPTQDistributed, setup_logger

setup_logger()

model_config = ModelConfig(
    model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
    device="cuda:0",
)
gptq = GPTQ(wbits=4, groupsize=128)

global_ptq = GlobalPTQDistributed(
    epochs=5,
    gptq_lr=1e-5,
    deepspeed_config="ds_zero2.json",
    calibration_config=CalibrationConfig(
        num_calibration_samples=128,
        max_length=2048,
    ),
)

runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=gptq,
    post_processes=[global_ptq],
)
runner.run()
```

Launch with `torchrun`:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 my_script.py
```

### GlobalPTQ Key Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `epochs` | `5` | Number of distillation epochs |
| `gptq_lr` | `1e-5` | Learning rate for GPTQ scales/zeros |
| `dbf_lr` | `5e-5` | Learning rate for DBF scaling parameters |
| `temperature` | `1.0` | Softmax temperature for KL divergence |
| `calibration_config` | `CalibrationConfig(num_calibration_samples=128)` | Calibration data configuration (see [CalibrationConfig](../api/calibration_config.md)) |
| `use_gradient_checkpointing` | `True` | Reduce GPU memory at the cost of recomputation |
| `early_stopping_patience` | `0` | Stop early if KL does not improve for N epochs (0 = disabled) |
| `use_mixed_precision` | `False` | Enable BF16 autocast to reduce memory |
| `grad_accum_steps` | `1` | Gradient accumulation steps |

> **Note — DBF vs GPTQ training differences:**
> When optimising **DBF** scaling factors, Global PTQ uses plain Adam (not AdamW) without a learning-rate scheduler.
> For **GPTQ** scales/zeros, it uses AdamW with a cosine-warmup LR schedule.
> Adjust `dbf_lr` and `gptq_lr` independently for best results.

> **Note — Mixed GPTQ + DBF models:**
> Global PTQ currently optimises a single quantization method per run.
> If a model contains both GPTQ and DBF layers (e.g. from AutoBit fallback), only GPTQ layers are optimised and a warning is logged.
> Joint GPTQ + DBF optimisation is planned for a future release.

### GlobalPTQDistributed Additional Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `deepspeed_config` | `None` | Path to DeepSpeed config JSON |
| `w_distill` | `1.0` | Weight for KL distillation loss |
| `w_ntp` | `0.0` | Weight for next-token prediction loss |
| `bf16` | `True` | Enable bfloat16 training |
| `per_device_train_batch_size` | `1` | Batch size per GPU |
| `gradient_accumulation_steps` | `1` | Gradient accumulation steps |

See the [API Reference](../api/post_process.md) for the full parameter list.

!!! info "Save / Load"
    GlobalPTQ and GlobalPTQDistributed update quantized-layer buffers without
    introducing custom module types, so optimised models can be saved with
    `save_quantized_model()` and reloaded with `load_quantized_model()`. They
    also record an entry under
    `quantization_config["onecomp_post_processes"]`, so the saved checkpoint
    retains the post-process audit trail across load → post-process → re-save
    cycles. Skipped runs (no quantized layers, unsupported method, or zero
    trainable parameters) are recorded with `executed: false` and a `reason`
    (`not_quantized`, `unsupported_method_<method>`, `no_params`). The `.pt` path remains available when whole-object PyTorch
    serialization is explicitly needed.

## Block-wise PTQ

Block-wise PTQ improves quantized model accuracy by minimising intermediate-representation MSE against an FP16 teacher at Transformer-block granularity. It supports GPTQLinear-backed quantizers (GPTQ, RTN, JointQ), DBF, and Onebit.

### How it works

1. **Phase 1 (Greedy per-block distillation)** — For each Transformer block, optimise quantization parameters (scales, zeros, binary matrices) so the block's output matches the FP16 teacher block's output.
2. **Phase 2 CBQ (Cross-Block Quantisation)** — Jointly optimise pairs of adjacent blocks with a sliding window (K=2) to reduce error accumulation from the greedy Phase 1.

Only 1–2 blocks are loaded onto GPU at a time, so large models can be processed without loading the entire model into GPU memory.

### Usage via Runner

```python
from onecomp import DBF, GPTQ, JointQ, Onebit, RTN, BlockWisePTQ, ModelConfig, Runner, setup_logger

setup_logger()

model_config = ModelConfig(
    model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
    device="cuda:0",
)
quantizer = GPTQ(wbits=4, groupsize=128)
# quantizer = RTN(wbits=4, groupsize=128)
# quantizer = JointQ(bits=4, group_size=128)
# quantizer = DBF(target_bits=1.5)
# quantizer = Onebit()

blockwise_ptq = BlockWisePTQ(
    lr=1e-4,
    epochs=10,
    cbq_enable=True,
    gptq_lr=1e-3,
)

runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=quantizer,
    post_processes=[blockwise_ptq],
)
runner.run()

original_ppl, _, quantized_ppl = runner.calculate_perplexity(
    original_model=True, quantized_model=True,
)
print(f"Original PPL:                    {original_ppl:.4f}")
print(f"Quantized + BlockWisePTQ PPL:    {quantized_ppl:.4f}")
```

### Direct invocation

You can also call BlockWisePTQ directly on an existing quantized model to compare before/after PPL without re-running quantization:

```python
runner = Runner(model_config=model_config, quantizer=quantizer)
runner.run()

# Baseline PPL
_, _, baseline_ppl = runner.calculate_perplexity(quantized_model=True)

# Apply BlockWisePTQ
# pack_weights defaults to True (matches run_post_processes); use_gemlite=False
# keeps the plain PyTorch path the block optimiser needs.
model, _ = runner.create_quantized_model(use_gemlite=False)
blockwise_ptq.run(model, model_config)
runner.quantized_model = model

# Improved PPL
_, _, improved_ppl = runner.calculate_perplexity(quantized_model=True)
```

!!! tip
    A complete working example of the Runner-managed packed/default path is
    available at
    [`example/post_process/example_blockwise_ptq.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_blockwise_ptq.py).
    The explicit unpacked path (`create_quantized_model(pack_weights=False)`
    → `BlockWisePTQ.run()`) is only needed when GPTQLinear bit packing cannot
    represent the quantizer output (e.g. 1-bit JointQ, or GPTQ/RTN bit widths
    outside `{2, 3, 4, 8}`); see the `BlockWisePTQ` API reference for that path.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `lr` | `1e-4` | Learning rate for block-wise optimisation (DBF / OneBit / generic) |
| `epochs` | `10` | Number of optimisation epochs per block |
| `cbq_enable` | `False` | Enable Phase 2 Cross-Block Quantisation |
| `gptq_lr` | `1e-3` | Learning rate for GPTQ scales/zeros optimisation |
| `gptq_optimize_intweight` | `False` | Optimise integer weights via Smooth STE (GPTQ) |
| `gptq_intweight_lr` | `1e-4` | Learning rate for integer weight optimisation |
| `grad_clip` | `1.0` | Gradient clipping norm |
| `optimize_binary` | `True` | Optimise binary/sign matrices (DBF / OneBit) |
| `k_smooth` | `100.0` | SmoothSign STE temperature |
| `num_calibration_samples` | `128` | Number of calibration samples |
| `max_length` | `2048` | Sequence length for calibration data |

See the [API Reference](../api/post_process.md) for the full parameter list.

!!! info "Save / Load"
    BlockWisePTQ-optimised models can be saved with `save_quantized_model()` and
    reloaded with `load_quantized_model()`. On the standard Runner path
    (`run()` → `run_post_processes()` → `save_quantized_model()`) the quantized
    model is built with packed buffers by default, so the saved checkpoint keeps
    the packed layout. A saved checkpoint can also be reloaded, refined with
    further post-processes, and saved again; the applied post-processes are
    recorded under `quantization_config["onecomp_post_processes"]` as an audit
    trail across save/load cycles.

## Router Fine-Tuning for Quantized MoE Models

Quantization changes expert outputs even when the router itself remains in full
precision. `RouterFineTuning` adapts routing decisions to those quantized expert
outputs using standard shifted next-token prediction loss. Before training, all
parameters are frozen and only parameters below exact module-name components
`router`, `gate`, and `shared_expert_gate` are enabled. Exact matching means
expert layers such as `gate_proj` remain frozen.

```python
from onecomp import GPTQ, CalibrationConfig, ModelConfig, RouterFineTuning, Runner

model_config = ModelConfig(model_id="Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B", device="cuda:0")
runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=GPTQ(wbits=4, groupsize=128),
    calibration_config=CalibrationConfig(max_length=512, num_calibration_samples=128),
    post_processes=[
        RouterFineTuning(
            dataset_name="Salesforce/wikitext",
            dataset_config_name="wikitext-2-raw-v1",
            max_train_samples=512,
            max_length=512,
            epochs=1,
            batch_size=1,
            gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
            lr=1e-5,
        )
    ],
)
runner.run()
```

For architectures with another router name, pass exact path components via
`router_modules=("custom_router",)`. Local `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv`, `.txt`,
and `.parquet` files are accepted through `data_files`; set `text_column` when
the text field is not named `text`.

During training, packed GPTQ layers are temporarily unpacked so gradients can
flow through quantized experts to routing scores. Their incoming packed state is
restored afterward. The process introduces no custom module type, so the result
uses the normal `save_quantized_model()` and `load_quantized_model()` workflow.

!!! tip
    A complete baseline-versus-fine-tuned perplexity example is available at
    [`example/post_process/example_router_fine_tuning.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_router_fine_tuning.py).

## LoRA SFT: Accuracy Recovery

The most common use case is recovering accuracy lost during quantization. Provide a general-purpose dataset (e.g., WikiText-2) to fine-tune the quantized model:

```python
from onecomp import GPTQ, ModelConfig, Runner, PostProcessLoraSFT, setup_logger

setup_logger()

model_config = ModelConfig(
    model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
    device="cuda:0",
)
gptq = GPTQ(wbits=4, groupsize=128)

post_process = PostProcessLoraSFT(
    dataset_name="Salesforce/wikitext",
    dataset_config_name="wikitext-2-raw-v1",
    train_split="train",
    text_column="text",
    max_train_samples=256,
    max_length=512,
    epochs=4,
    batch_size=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
    lr=1e-4,
    lora_r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
)

runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=gptq,
    post_processes=[post_process],
)
runner.run()

# Evaluate: PPL should be lower than without LoRA SFT
original_ppl, _, quantized_ppl = runner.calculate_perplexity(
    original_model=True, quantized_model=True,
)
print(f"Original PPL:              {original_ppl:.4f}")
print(f"Quantized + LoRA SFT PPL:  {quantized_ppl:.4f}")
```

!!! tip
    A complete working example is available at
    [`example/post_process/example_lora_sft.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_lora_sft.py).

---

## LoRA SFT: Knowledge Injection

LoRA SFT also supports injecting new knowledge into a quantized model using custom training data. Provide a JSONL file where each line has a `"text"` field:

```json
{"text": "OneCompression (OneComp) is an open-source Python library for LLM quantization developed by Fujitsu."}
{"text": "OneComp supports GPTQ, DBF, RTN, and AutoBit quantization methods."}
```

Then pass the file path to `data_files`:

```python
post_process = PostProcessLoraSFT(
    data_files="./my_knowledge.jsonl",
    max_length=256,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=2,
    lr=3e-4,
    lora_r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
)

runner = Runner(
    model_config=model_config,
    quantizer=gptq,
    post_processes=[post_process],
)
runner.run()
```

After training, the model can generate responses based on the injected knowledge.

!!! tip
    A complete working example with before/after comparison is available at
    [`example/post_process/example_lora_sft_knowledge.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_lora_sft_knowledge.py).

## Saving and Loading LoRA Models

LoRA-applied models are saved and loaded with the standard
`save_quantized_model()` / `load_quantized_model()` API. When `LoRAGPTQLinear`
modules are present, `save_quantized_model()` writes the base quantized weights
as HF-compatible safetensors and the LoRA weights as a PEFT-format adapter
sidecar (`lora_adapter/adapter_model.safetensors` + `adapter_config.json`).
`load_quantized_model()` auto-detects the sidecar and re-wraps the matching
layers with `LoRAGPTQLinear` on load.

### Save

```python
# After quantization + LoRA SFT
runner.run()

# Save the LoRA-applied model (HF-compatible safetensors + PEFT sidecar)
runner.save_quantized_model("./my_model_lora")
```

### Load

```python
from onecomp import load_quantized_model

# The LoRA adapter sidecar is auto-detected and re-applied on load.
model, tokenizer = load_quantized_model("./my_model_lora")
```

!!! info "save_quantized_model vs save_quantized_model_pt"
    Outputs from **all** built-in post-processes — `BlockWisePTQ`, `GlobalPTQ`,
    `GlobalPTQDistributed`, and `PostProcessLoraSFT` and its teacher variants —
    are saved and loaded through the standard `save_quantized_model()` /
    `load_quantized_model()` path. None of them requires the legacy `.pt` path.

    | Method | Format | Use Case |
    |--------|--------|----------|
    | `save_quantized_model()` | HF-compatible safetensors; LoRA adds a `lora_adapter/` PEFT sidecar | Standard path for supported quantized models and all built-in post-process outputs. vLLM compatibility depends on the saved `quant_method` |
    | `save_quantized_model_pt()` | PyTorch `.pt` whole-object serialization | Legacy research/development path, e.g. for custom module types that the safetensors loader cannot reconstruct |

    Use `load_quantized_model()` for safetensors and `load_quantized_model_pt()`
    only for legacy `.pt` checkpoints.

### Legacy `.pt` save/load (research/development only)

The PyTorch `.pt` format (`save_quantized_model_pt()` /
`load_quantized_model_pt()`) serializes full custom module objects (e.g.
`LoRAGPTQLinear`) directly. It predates the safetensors sidecar flow above and
is **not recommended** for general or production use. Every in-tree
post-process, LoRA SFT included, has a safetensors save/load path, so this
format is not needed for them. Keep using it only for research and development
-- for example, to quickly experiment with a post-process of your own before it
has a safetensors-compatible `load_quantized_model()` path.

```python
from onecomp import load_quantized_model_pt

# Save (legacy .pt format)
runner.save_quantized_model_pt("./my_model_lora_pt")

# Load -- opt-in required: the .pt loader uses torch.load(weights_only=False),
# which can execute code from a malicious file. Trusted sources only.
model, tokenizer = load_quantized_model_pt(
    "./my_model_lora_pt", allow_unsafe_deserialization=True
)
```

!!! warning "Unsafe deserialization (.pt loader)"
    `load_quantized_model_pt()` deserializes `model.pt` with
    `torch.load(..., weights_only=False)`, which uses Python `pickle` and can
    execute arbitrary code from a malicious file (CWE-502). It refuses to load
    unless you pass `allow_unsafe_deserialization=True`. Only opt in for models
    you produced yourself or trust completely; otherwise use the safetensors
    `load_quantized_model()`, which does not execute code.

See the [API Reference](../api/post_process.md) for the full parameter list.

## Advanced: Teacher Distillation

Teacher distillation aligns the quantized model's output distribution with a full-precision teacher model. This can improve accuracy beyond what SFT alone achieves:

```python
post_process = PostProcessLoraSFT(
    dataset_name="Salesforce/wikitext",
    dataset_config_name="wikitext-2-raw-v1",
    train_split="train",
    text_column="text",
    sft_loss_weight=1.0,
    teacher_loss_weight=0.5,           # Enable teacher distillation
    teacher_loss_type="kl",            # "kl" or "mse"
    teacher_temperature=1.0,
    teacher_model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",  # Full-precision teacher
    cache_teacher_outputs=True,        # Pre-compute teacher logits for speed
)
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `sft_loss_weight` | `1.0` | Weight for causal LM (SFT) loss |
| `teacher_loss_weight` | `0.0` | Weight for teacher distillation loss (0 = disabled) |
| `teacher_loss_type` | `"kl"` | `"kl"` (KL divergence) or `"mse"` (mean squared error) on logits |
| `teacher_temperature` | `1.0` | Temperature for softening teacher logits |
| `teacher_model_id` | `None` | Hugging Face model ID for the teacher |
| `teacher_model_path` | `None` | Local path for the teacher model |
| `cache_teacher_outputs` | `False` | Pre-compute and cache teacher outputs on CPU |

## Advanced: Intermediate Block Alignment

Intermediate block alignment adds a loss term that aligns hidden states at selected transformer blocks between the teacher and student models:

```python
post_process = PostProcessLoraSFT(
    dataset_name="Salesforce/wikitext",
    dataset_config_name="wikitext-2-raw-v1",
    train_split="train",
    text_column="text",
    teacher_model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
    intermediate_block_loss_weight=0.1,
    intermediate_block_indices=[8, 16, 24],
    cache_intermediate_outputs=True,
)
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `intermediate_block_loss_weight` | `0.0` | Weight for intermediate alignment loss (0 = disabled) |
| `intermediate_block_indices` | `None` | Transformer block indices to align |
| `cache_intermediate_outputs` | `False` | Pre-compute and cache teacher block outputs |

## Limitations

!!! info "vLLM Inference"
    LoRA-applied models saved with `save_quantized_model()` (base safetensors +
    PEFT adapter sidecar) can be served by vLLM via its native LoRA mechanism:
    load with `enable_lora=True` and pass a
    `LoRARequest(lora_path=".../lora_adapter")`. See
    [`example/post_process/example_lora_gptq_vllm_inference.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/post_process/example_lora_gptq_vllm_inference.py).
    Models saved with the legacy `save_quantized_model_pt()` (`.pt`) format are
    **not** servable by vLLM — re-save with `save_quantized_model()` for vLLM.

    For standard quantized models, and for post-processes that keep the
    quantized layer structure such as `BlockWisePTQ`, `GlobalPTQ`, and
    `GlobalPTQDistributed`, use `save_quantized_model()`. Models whose saved
    `quant_method` is supported by vLLM can then be served as described in the
    [vLLM Inference guide](vllm-inference.md).

!!! note "Supported Quantizers"
    LoRA SFT currently supports **GPTQ**-quantized models only. Support for other quantization methods (DBF, RTN) may be added in the future.
